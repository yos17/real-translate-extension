Real-Time Voice Translator – Product Requirements Document
Overview
Project Name: "Claude Code" Real-Time Voice Translator (working title)
Goal: Enable real-time translation of spoken Indonesian (and other languages) into German (or another target language) through a web-based interface or browser extension. A user can speak into a microphone and see their words transcribed and translated in real time on a Chrome browser. The application should run continuously in the background once activated, providing seamless voice-to-text and translation functionality. This PRD outlines the feature set from basic to advanced, guiding a solo developer through iterative development steps. Inspiration: The project draws inspiration from tools like Wispr Flow, an AI voice dictation app known for accurate, effortless voice-to-text across 100+ languages

. We aim to achieve similar seamless voice recognition and translation, within the scope of a web/Chrome-based solution.
Key Features and Phases
The development will progress in stages, from a simple MVP (speech recognition) to more advanced capabilities (continuous background operation, extension integration, etc.). Each phase adds functionality in a logical order:
Phase 1: Real-Time Speech Recognition (Transcription MVP)
Description: Implement microphone input capture and real-time speech-to-text transcription. When the user speaks Indonesian (or another source language) into the microphone, the system will detect the speech and convert it to text, outputting the spoken sentence (initially to the console or a basic UI).
Microphone Access & Permissions: Utilize the browser’s Web Speech API (or equivalent) to access the device microphone and capture audio. The user must grant microphone permission for the web app/extension to start listening
medium.com
. The app should handle permission prompts gracefully and alert the user if access is denied.
Speech Recognition Engine: Leverage Chrome’s built-in SpeechRecognition interface for real-time transcription. For example, the Web Speech API’s SpeechRecognition (or webkitSpeechRecognition) can continuously recognize speech and provide interim results
medium.com
. This allows updating the transcript in real-time as the user speaks.
Implementation detail: Set recognition.continuous = true for ongoing listening, and recognition.interimResults = true to retrieve partial (interim) transcripts while speaking
medium.com
. This way, the user’s speech is captured continuously until they stop or pause.
Language Selection (Input): Configure the recognition language to Indonesian (or the user’s chosen source language). Note: The Web Speech API requires specifying the input language up-front and supports only certain languages; the user or system should select "id-ID" for Indonesian, for example
medium.com
. (In the future, an auto-detect feature could be considered, but initially the user will choose the source language.)
Real-Time Transcript Output: As speech is recognized, display the transcribed text. Initially, this can be a console log for development verification. For a user-facing UI, show the recognized sentence in a text area or on-screen element. If interim results are enabled, update the text in real-time (e.g. greyed-out partial text that becomes solid when finalized).
Accuracy and Reliability: The app should handle basic sentence-level transcription. It may not be perfect initially (especially for names or accents), but it should capture most spoken words. We acknowledge that accuracy might be limited by the underlying engine and network conditions. (Chrome’s speech recognition uses Google’s cloud engine behind the scenes, so an internet connection is required and data is sent to a server
developer.mozilla.org
.)
Feedback & Controls: Provide a way to start/stop listening. For example, a “Start Listening” button (on a webpage) or voice command/keyboard shortcut in an extension. When active, indicate recording status (e.g., a red dot or microphone icon). Allow the user to stop the transcription with a button or command, which will turn off the microphone to cease listening.
Acceptance Criteria: By the end of Phase 1, speaking a sentence (e.g. "Selamat pagi, apa kabar?") into the microphone will result in that sentence (in Indonesian) being captured and printed to the console or displayed on-screen. The system can continuously handle multiple sentences in sequence after activation, until stopped.
Phase 2: Automated Translation of Captured Text
Description: Once the speech-to-text pipeline is working, integrate a translation layer. The transcribed input (e.g. in Indonesian) should be automatically translated into the target language (German, in the primary use-case) and prepared for display.
Translation Engine Selection: Use a reliable translation API or service to convert the source text to the target language. One straightforward option is the Google Cloud Translation API, which can translate text given a source and target language code
medium.com
. For example, after obtaining an API key, a request can be made to Google’s translation endpoint with parameters source=id (Indonesian), target=de (German), and the text to translate
medium.com
. The API will return the translated text.
Alternatively, the DeepL API is an option for high-quality translations; it supports Indonesian-to-German among many language pairs
support.deepl.com
. DeepL or Google should be chosen based on cost, performance, and required accuracy. (Both require an API key and may incur usage costs or rate limits
medium.com
.)
Implementing Translation Call: Integrate the API call in the app’s workflow. After each final transcription result is obtained in Phase 1, send the text to the translation service. This can be done via an asynchronous HTTP request (e.g., using fetch or XHR in JavaScript). Ensure to handle the response and parse out the translated text string
medium.com
.
Error Handling & Rate Limits: Account for possible errors in translation – e.g., API not reachable, quota exceeded, or the source text is empty. If a translation API call fails, the system should log an error and perhaps retry or alert the user gracefully. Also consider the translation API’s rate limits; if the user speaks rapidly or at length, implement a short cooldown or queue to avoid hitting limits.
Output of Translation (Console/UI): For development, log the translated text to the console alongside the original. For the user interface, plan to display the translated sentence clearly, separate from the original. For example, show it below the original or replace the original text with the translated text once available. In a simple UI, you might have two fields: “Detected Speech” and “Translation”.
Language Selection (Target): Allow configuration of the target language (default to German for this use case). In the UI, this could be a dropdown (with “German” pre-selected). The system should support other target languages as well, translating from Indonesian (or the chosen source) to the desired language. This adds flexibility for future use (e.g., Indonesian to English, English to German, etc., as long as the API supports it).
Acceptance Criteria: After Phase 2, the application will output a translated sentence for each spoken input. For example, if the user says "Selamat pagi, apa kabar?" (Indonesian for "Good morning, how are you?"), the system might display the translation "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?" in German. The process from speaking to seeing translated text should feel near real-time (with only a brief pause during translation API call).
Phase 3: Displaying Translated Text in the Chrome Browser
Description: With transcription and translation working, the next step is to present the translated text in a user-friendly way within the Chrome browser environment. This phase focuses on how the output appears to the user and ensures the solution is web-based as specified (e.g., a web app or Chrome extension UI).
Web Interface / Page Output: Develop a simple web interface (if running as a web app) that shows the results. This could be a dedicated webpage that the user opens: it would have a “Start” button (to begin listening, from Phase 1) and text areas or sections showing the Original Speech and the Translated Text. The translated version should be clearly visible in the Chrome browser tab when the user speaks. If this is done as a quick web demo, one can print the translated text to the page dynamically via JavaScript (e.g., updating innerText of an HTML element).
Chrome Extension Integration: Ultimately, the goal is to have this run as a Chrome extension (per requirements #3 and #4). This means packaging the functionality in an extension that can be activated via a browser button or keyboard shortcut. For Phase 3, focus on getting the extension to display translation results in a convenient way:
Browser Action Popup: The extension can have a popup (the small window that appears when you click the extension icon). This popup could contain the UI from above – a start/stop button and fields for original and translated text. The user would click the extension icon, click “Start Listening”, then speak; the popup would then show the live transcript and final translation.
Content Script Overlay (Optional): Another approach is having the extension inject an overlay or sidebar on the current webpage to show translations. For example, a small floating window in the page that updates with the latest translated text. This would allow the user to see translations without switching context (useful if they are conversing or writing on a web page). This is an advanced UI idea and could be done in Phase 5, but it's worth noting as an option.
Direct Text Insertion (Advanced Option): In scenarios where the user is using another web application (say writing an email or document in Indonesian), the extension could automatically insert the translated German text into the active text field. This effectively turns the speech translator into an input method. While this is complex to do generally, it is analogous to how Wispr Flow works by acting as a voice keyboard that types for you
techcrunch.com
. This could be explored later as an enhancement (see Advanced Features), but is noted here as the ultimate integration goal (speak Indonesian, and the German text types itself into whatever web text field or editor the user has selected).
User Feedback: Ensure the translated text displayed is easily readable (large font or distinct styling). Possibly show a small notification or highlight when a new translation is added, especially if running in the background (to draw the user’s attention that their speech was captured and translated).
Acceptance Criteria: By the end of Phase 3, a non-technical user can activate the translator and see their spoken words translated in Chrome. For example, as a web app: the user navigates to the translator page, clicks “Start”, speaks a sentence, and then sees on that page the original text and the translated German text. Or as an extension: the user clicks the extension icon, starts it, and sees the translated text appear in the extension’s popup interface. The core requirement is visual confirmation of the translation in the browser, completing the loop from speech to visible translated text.
Phase 4: Activation & Continuous Background Operation
Description: Refine the application to run continuously in the background once activated, aligning with the requirement that it should function as a hands-free translator after initial user activation (via a button in the web UI or a CLI/command for advanced users). This phase focuses on the operational mode of the translator – ensuring it can remain active and accessible while the user does other tasks.
One-Click Activation & Deactivation: Provide a clear way to activate the continuous listening mode. For the web interface, this could be a toggle button (“Start Translation” / “Stop Translation”). For a CLI version (if needed), a command could launch the translator process. In a Chrome extension, clicking the icon (or a keyboard shortcut) could toggle the service on/off. When active, the extension might change its icon color to indicate it’s listening. Users should be able to turn it off easily to prevent unwanted listening.
Background Listening: Ensure that once activated, the speech recognition keeps running even if the user switches tabs or applications. In a web page implementation, the page needs to remain open and microphone active (which might stop if the page is not in focus unless implemented as an extension or with special permissions). As a Chrome extension, use background scripts or service workers that can keep running and capture audio. Chrome extensions can use the [background service worker] for continuous tasks and the extension’s popup or content script for UI updates. The design should allow the app to continue listening until the user manually stops it (or possibly until a certain idle time passes).
Performance Considerations: Running continuously means the app should be efficient. The speech recognition API will be streaming audio to Google’s servers (for Chrome’s engine) continuously
developer.mozilla.org
, which could impact network and battery. We should document and possibly mitigate this:
Perhaps automatically pause or lower activity when no speech is detected for some time (to save resources), then resume on voice activity (voice activity detection). If the Web Speech API doesn’t handle this inherently, we might implement a manual toggle or periodic re-initialization.
Ensure memory is managed (for example, avoid memory leaks by resetting the recognition or handling long transcripts properly).
CLI Mode (if applicable): The requirement mentions activation via a command-line interface as an alternative to a button. This suggests offering a Node.js script or Python script that can be run to start the translator. This would be outside the browser context. If provided, the CLI tool could use the device microphone and perhaps the same APIs (maybe via an SDK or cloud service) to output translations to the console. This is a secondary interface, but could be useful for testing or power users. (This might require separate implementation using OS-specific speech libraries or cloud STT since Web Speech API is browser-based. It can be considered if time permits, but is optional in scope.)
Extension Packaging: By now, packaging everything as a Chrome extension is desirable. This means:
Creating a manifest.json for the extension with appropriate permissions (microphone, possibly activeTab if injecting content, etc.).
Background script or service worker to handle continuous listening.
A popup or options page for UI and settings (language choices, start/stop).
Possibly content script if integrating with web pages directly.
The extension should be loadable in Developer Mode on Chrome and run the translator as designed.
Acceptance Criteria: In Phase 4, the translator can remain on without constant user intervention. For instance, the user clicks “Start” once, and then they can carry on a conversation or multitask while the app keeps translating any speech it hears until “Stop” is pressed. In a demo scenario: the user activates the extension, then opens a new tab to compose an email – as they speak Indonesian, the extension still captures it and perhaps shows the German text in a small overlay or just in the extension popup, ready to be copied into the email. The key is that the service doesn’t stop when navigating away or doing other work, making it truly real-time and continuous.
Phase 5: Advanced Features and Enhancements (Future Roadmap)
In the final phase, we consider additional features to elevate the translator from a basic functional tool to a more polished, robust product. These could be implemented incrementally after the core functionality is stable:
Bi-Directional Translation & Multi-Language Support: While initially focusing on Indonesian -> German, the system can be extended to support multiple language pairs. Allow the user to select any supported input language and output language (e.g., English to French, German to Indonesian, etc.). The UI can provide dropdowns for both “Input Language” and “Output Language.” Additionally, consider automatic language detection for the input speech in the future, so that the user doesn’t have to manually switch input language – though this may require using a different STT service or an initial detection step.
Voice Output (Speech Synthesis): To make the translator more powerful (closer to a universal translator), implement text-to-speech for the translated text. After showing the German text, the app could optionally speak it out using the browser’s Speech Synthesis API
medium.com
medium.com
. For example, if the user speaks Indonesian, the app would display the German translation and also read it aloud in a German voice. This would involve selecting an appropriate voice for the target language (e.g., a German voice) and playing it via the web speech synthesis engine. This feature turns the app into a two-way communication tool (the user talks, the app translates and speaks for them).
Improved UI/UX: Polishing the interface:
Show live feedback while talking (e.g., a waveform or a microphone level indicator to assure the user it’s hearing them).
Display interim transcripts (perhaps in a lighter color) updating in real-time, then finalize the text when complete – providing a smoother experience as the user sees their speech being captured live (a technique shown to improve perceived responsiveness
medium.com
).
Provide clear notifications or sound cues when translation is ready (a beep or highlight).
If using as an overlay on web pages, allow the user to drag/move the translation box or minimize it.
Custom Vocabulary and Learning: Incorporate the ability to handle custom names, terms, or acronyms that the user frequently uses. For example, a user’s name or industry-specific terms could be added to a dictionary to improve recognition accuracy – similar to Wispr Flow’s dictionary feature that “learns custom names and terms automatically, or allows adding them manually”
techcrunch.com
. Over time, the translator could adapt to the user’s voice and vocabulary, increasing accuracy for those terms. This might involve caching corrected transcripts or using an STT service that supports custom language models.
Performance and Offline Mode: To reduce dependency on external services and improve responsiveness, consider integrating offline or local models. For instance, OpenAI’s Whisper or Whisper.cpp could run locally for speech recognition (some projects allow running Whisper in-browser or on-device for short utterances). A local model would enable offline usage and privacy (no audio leaves the device)
developer.mozilla.org
. Likewise, offline translation models (though less advanced than cloud services) could be explored. This is complex and may require significant compute resources, so it could be optional or for powerful devices only. However, supporting even a limited offline mode would address scenarios of poor network connectivity – a strength that Wispr Flow also touts (working even with weak network)
techcrunch.com
.
Cross-Platform and Compatibility: While Chrome on desktop is the primary target, consider making the solution work on other environments:
Other Browsers: The Web Speech API is supported in Chrome and some other Chromium-based browsers, but not universally. If needed, look into alternatives for Firefox (which might not support Web Speech recognition as of now) or Safari. Perhaps use a fallback to an external speech API if the browser doesn’t support it.
Mobile: Ensure that the web app or extension is usable on Chrome for Android, or create a simplified mobile web page. Mobile devices already have Google voice typing, but a web-based translator that’s always listening could be useful on mobile too. This might involve UI adjustments for smaller screens.
Platform-Specific Integrations: In the long run, one could package this as a desktop app (using Electron or Tauri, for example) to integrate more deeply with the OS, or even as a mobile app. These go beyond the initial scope but are possibilities.
Security & Privacy Considerations: As an advanced consideration, communicate to users how their voice data is used. If using Google’s STT via Chrome, audio is sent to Google’s servers
developer.mozilla.org
– some users might be concerned. In future, giving an option for local processing or explicitly stating what data is sent where in a privacy policy is important. Also, ensure the extension is secure (minimal permissions, data encryption if any network calls with API keys, etc.).
These advanced features are not required for the initial release, but they form a roadmap for future improvements. Implementing them would enhance user experience, broaden the user base (more languages and use-cases), and make the translator more competitive with professional solutions.
Technical Considerations and Research Findings
Feasibility of Core Features: Research confirms that the core functionality is achievable with current web technologies. Chrome’s Web Speech API can handle real-time speech recognition in supported languages (including Indonesian) and can provide transcripts dynamically
medium.com
. For translation, well-documented APIs like Google Translate are available and have been demonstrated in browser contexts
medium.com
. Combining these in a web app yields a working speech translator as shown by existing demos
medium.com
. This project essentially builds on these known techniques, tailoring them to Indonesian-German and integrating into a continuous workflow.
Wispr Flow Comparison: Wispr Flow’s impressive performance (high accuracy for non-native accents, ability to function as a system-wide voice keyboard) sets a high bar. As a solo developer, matching all its capabilities is challenging, but key lessons can be applied:
Use the best available speech recognition for accuracy (potentially experiment with cloud services vs. browser default to see which understands Indonesian speech better). Wispr’s secret sauce includes AI models that improve with usage; while we may not implement learning in MVP, we can focus on clarity and some customization.
The hotkey activation and background operation in Wispr is similar to our Phase 4 goals (quickly start/stop dictation globally)
techcrunch.com
.
Multi-language support in Wispr (100+ languages) shows our design should be flexible; hence we include language selectors and do not hard-code Indonesian/German beyond defaults
techcrunch.com
.
Known Limitations:
The Web Speech API on Chrome may occasionally stop listening after long pauses or extended use. We should be prepared to restart the recognition (perhaps automatically) if onend is called unexpectedly
medium.com
medium.com
. Robustness will be important for continuous mode.
Using cloud APIs means internet connection is required. No network means the translator will not function (until an offline mode is added in future).
There may be slight latency between speaking and seeing the translation, especially due to the translation API call. We expect perhaps ~1 second delay as observed in similar implementations
medium.com
. This is generally acceptable, but we aim to keep it minimal (by processing as soon as final speech is recognized).
API Costs: Google’s Translation API is paid beyond a free tier, and DeepL has limits for free accounts. If this is a personal or small-scale project, costs should be manageable (Indonesian-German text is typically short messages). Still, if usage grows, the developer should monitor API usage or consider self-hosted translation solutions.
Testing: We will test the translator with various phrases in Indonesian and verify the German output accuracy. It’s important to test with different speakers to ensure the STT works for multiple accents/dialects of Indonesian. Also, test the entire flow in real usage scenarios: e.g., simulate writing an email by speaking and copying the translated text, or having a spoken conversation where responses are translated. Feedback from such tests can guide tweaks (like adjusting the microphone sensitivity or translation language formality).
Conclusion
This PRD has detailed the step-by-step plan for building a real-time voice translator, from a basic speech-to-text prototype to a full-featured Chrome extension with translation and potential voice output. By following these phases, a solo developer can incrementally implement and validate each part: first capturing voice input, then translating it (Indonesian to German as primary example), then integrating the output seamlessly into a web browser context. The document also outlines how the tool will operate continuously after activation and sketches out future enhancements (multi-language, voice output, offline capabilities) inspired by leading products like Wispr Flow. By adhering to this roadmap, the end result will be an effective web-based translator that lets users speak in one language and read (or even hear) their words in another language in real time – all within their browser. This empowers easier communication and productivity across language barriers, leveraging modern AI and web technologies to make the process as effortless as possible.
